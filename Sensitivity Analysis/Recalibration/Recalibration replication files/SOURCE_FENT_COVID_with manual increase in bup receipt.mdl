	~	[ASM] Weight parameter determining the relative importance of prescription \

		affecting the supply of 'excess' Rx available for misuse. A value of 1 is \

		indicates that diversion is driven more by the number of people with a \
		prescription, while a value greater than 1 indicates diversion is driven \
		more by the strength of presriptions.

		consistent with both TEDS and prior NSDUH data that show significantly \
		higher rates of treatment engagement from individuals with HUD vs OUD. \

		that the barriers faced by Rx OUD vs HUD do not differ in their relative \

Adjust to change the extrapolation of each exogenous input series. Modify to set final values for each extrapolation and final times at which those values are reached. To view each combined exogenous input and extrapolation, use the rightmost column with the Graph tool.

Policy levers are operationalized as % changes to the relevant parameter or input time series. All levers have the same absolute directionality, i.e. positive values increase the parameter or time series while negative values decrease it. For variables with a 0-1 probability range, a policy change of -1 means 0% probability and a policy change of 1 means 100% probability. Levers can be adjusted in combination with different magnitudes and directions, as appropriate, to test policies with multiple effects or to test multiple simultaneous policies. All policy levers take effect at the same time, specified using the Policy Activation Time slider (default 2020). The default is a 1-year ramp for implementation.
